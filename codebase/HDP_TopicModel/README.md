=======================

This github directory contains our experiments about self-initiated research
project: a method to achieve acceleration by decomposing optimization to two subproblem.

    Makefile                for compilation
    README.md               records basic information
    
    HDP.cpp                 HDP codes
    HDP.h                   HDP header file

TODOs
---------------
1. identify clearly definition of loss and three regularization terms
2. design data structure for z, w 1-4 follows the same form. (sparse or
   regular)
3.
