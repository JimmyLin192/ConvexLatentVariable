Sparse convex optimization for Clustering
=======================

This github directory contains our experiments about self-initiated research
project: a method to achieve acceleration by decomposing optimization to two subproblem.

DEVELOPMENT LOGS
---------------

1. [Mon Jul 21 22:19:58 2014 by Jimmy] repository setup

2. [Mon Jul 21 22:20:22 2014 by Jimmy] modifies HDP function and frank\_wolfe

3. [Wed Jul 23 23:00:00 2014 by Jimmy and Ian] identify clearly definition of loss and three regularization terms

4. [Wed Jul 23 23:00:00 2014 by Jimmy and Ian] design data structure esmat for
   w, z and y

5. [Fri Jul 25 02:06:40 2014 by Jimmy] implement initial version of esmat and
   do corresponding modification on HDP.cpp based on sparseClustering.cpp

6. [Fri Jul 25 17:18:40 2014 by Jimmy] updated write-up to record the
   theoretical details. 

7. [Fri Jul 25 21:45:06 2014 by Jimmy] modify group\_lasso\_solver by using
   esmat

8. [Sat Jul 26 20:55:33 2014 by Jimmy] write functions that read voc.txt and
   doc.txt, test the availability. (Designed tests all passed.)

9. [Sat Jul 26 21:56:09 2014 by Jimmy] extend esmat API for subsetting esmat
